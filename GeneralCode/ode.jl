#A set of Ordinary Differential Equations solvers of varying order. These are
#mostly made obsolete by 'DifferentialEquations.jl', but they may be useful in
#the future.
#
#ode7_8 is still used in my multiple shooting implementation.
#
#Included:
#   ode4            - fixed step, 4th order
#   ode5            - fixed step, 5th order
#   ode7            - fixed step, 7th order
#   ode78           - variable step, 7th order with 8th order checking
#   ode78_events    - variable step, 7th order with 8th order checking, and
#                     events functions allowed
#   ode7_8          - fixed step, 7th order with 8th order checking

function ode4(odefun,tspan,y0, varargin...)
  #ODE4  Solve differential equations with a non-adaptive method of order 4.
  #   Y = ODE4(ODEFUN,TSPAN,Y0) with TSPAN = [T1, T2, T3, ... TN] integrates
  #   the system of differential equations y' = f(t,y) by stepping from T0 to
  #   T1 to TN. Function ODEFUN(T,Y) must return f(t,y) in a column vector.
  #   The vector Y0 is the initial conditions at T0. Each row in the solution
  #   array Y corresponds to a time specified in TSPAN.
  #
  #   Y = ODE4(ODEFUN,TSPAN,Y0,P1,P2...) passes the additional parameters
  #   P1,P2... to the derivative function as ODEFUN(T,Y,P1,P2...).
  #
  #   This is a non-adaptive solver. The step sequence is determined by TSPAN
  #   but the derivative function ODEFUN is evaluated multiple times per step.
  #   The solver implements the classical Runge-Kutta method of order 4.
  #
  #   Example
  #         tspan = 0:0.1:20;
  #         y = ode4(@vdp1,tspan,[2 0]);
  #         plot(tspan,y(:,1));
  #     solves the system y' = vdp1(t,y) with a constant step size of 0.1,
  #     and plots the first component of the solution.

  #   The solver implements the Dormand-Prince method of order 5 in a general

  #
  # ode78 (v1.14) Integrates a system of ordinary differential equations using
  # 7th order formulas.
  #
  # This is a 7th-order accurate integrator therefore the local error normally
  # expected is O(h^8).  However, because this particular implementation
  # uses the 8th-order estimate for xout (i.e. local extrapolation) moving
  # forward with the 8th-order estimate will yield errors on the order of O(h^9).
  #
  # The order of the RK method is the order of the local *truncation* error, d,
  # which is the principle error term in the portion of the Taylor series
  # expansion that gets dropped, or intentionally truncated.  This is different
  # from the local error which is the difference between the estimated solution
  # and the actual, or true solution.  The local error is used in stepsize
  # selection and may be approximated by the difference between two estimates of
  # different order, l(h) = x_(O(h+1)) - x_(O(h)).  With this definition, the
  # local error will be as large as the error in the lower order method.
  # The local truncation error is within the group of terms that gets multipled
  # by h when solving for a solution from the general RK method.  Therefore, the
  # order-p solution created by the RK method will be roughly accurate to O(h^(p+1))
  # since the local truncation error shows up in the solution as h*d, which is
  # h times an O(h^(p)) term, or rather O(h^(p+1)).
  # Summary:   For an order-p accurate RK method,
  #            - the local truncation error is O(h^p)
  #            - the local error used for stepsize adjustment and that
  #              is actually realized in a solution is O(h^(p+1))
  #
  # This requires 13 function evaluations per integration step.

  # ode78 (v1.14) Integrates a system of ordinary differential equations using
  # 7th order formulas.
  #
  # This is a 7th-order accurate integrator therefore the local error normally
  # expected is O(h^8).  However, because this particular implementation
  # uses the 8th-order estimate for xout (i.e. local extrapolation) moving
  # forward with the 8th-order estimate will yield errors on the order of O(h^9).
  #
  # The order of the RK method is the order of the local *truncation* error, d,
  # which is the principle error term in the portion of the Taylor series
  # expansion that gets dropped, or intentionally truncated.  This is different
  # from the local error which is the difference between the estimated solution
  # and the actual, or true solution.  The local error is used in stepsize
  # selection and may be approximated by the difference between two estimates of
  # different order, l(h) = x_(O(h+1)) - x_(O(h)).  With this definition, the
  # local error will be as large as the error in the lower order method.
  # The local truncation error is within the group of terms that gets multipled
  # by h when solving for a solution from the general RK method.  Therefore, the
  # order-p solution created by the RK method will be roughly accurate to O(h^(p+1))
  # since the local truncation error shows up in the solution as h*d, which is
  # h times an O(h^(p)) term, or rather O(h^(p+1)).
  # Summary:   For an order-p accurate RK method,
  #            - the local truncation error is O(h^p)
  #            - the local error used for stepsize adjustment and that
  #              is actually realized in a solution is O(h^(p+1))

  #
  # ode78 (v1.14) Integrates a system of ordinary differential equations using
  # 7th order formulas.
  #
  # This is a 7th-order accurate integrator therefore the local error normally
  # expected is O(h^8).  However, because this particular implementation
  # uses the 8th-order estimate for xout (i.e. local extrapolation) moving
  # forward with the 8th-order estimate will yield errors on the order of O(h^9).
  #
  # The order of the RK method is the order of the local *truncation* error, d,
  # which is the principle error term in the portion of the Taylor series
  # expansion that gets dropped, or intentionally truncated.  This is different
  # from the local error which is the difference between the estimated solution
  # and the actual, or true solution.  The local error is used in stepsize
  # selection and may be approximated by the difference between two estimates of
  # different order, l(h) = x_(O(h+1)) - x_(O(h)).  With this definition, the
  # local error will be as large as the error in the lower order method.
  # The local truncation error is within the group of terms that gets multipled
  # by h when solving for a solution from the general RK method.  Therefore, the
  # order-p solution created by the RK method will be roughly accurate to O(h^(p+1))
  # since the local truncation error shows up in the solution as h*d, which is
  # h times an O(h^(p)) term, or rather O(h^(p+1)).
  # Summary:   For an order-p accurate RK method,
  #            - the local truncation error is O(h^p)
  #            - the local error used for stepsize adjustment and that
  #              is actually realized in a solution is O(h^(p+1))
  #
  # This requires 13 function evaluations per integration step.

  # [tout, xout] = ode78(FUN,tspan,x0,ode_fcn_format,tol,trace,count,hmax)
  #
  # INPUT:
  # FUN   - String containing name of user-supplied problem description.
  #         Call: xprime = fun(t,x) where FUN = 'fun'.
  #         t      - Time (scalar).
  #         x      - Solution column-vector.
  #         xprime - Returned derivative COLUMN-vector; xprime(i) = dx(i)/dt.
  # tspan - [ tstart, tfinal ]
  # x0    - Initial value COLUMN-vector.
  # ode_fcn_format - this specifies if the user-defined ode function is in
  #         the form:     xprime = fun(t,x)   (ode_fcn_format=0, default)
  #         or:           xprime = fun(x,t)   (ode_fcn_format=1)
  #         Matlab's solvers comply with ode_fcn_format=0 while
  #         Octave's lsode() and sdirk4() solvers comply with ode_fcn_format=1.
  # tol   - The desired accuracy. (optional, default: tol = 1.e-6).
  # trace - If nonzero, each step is printed. (optional, default: trace = 0).
  # count - if nonzero, variable 'rhs_counter' is initalized, made global
  #         and counts the number of state-dot function evaluations
  #         'rhs_counter' is incremented in here, not in the state-dot file
  #         simply make 'rhs_counter' global in the file that calls ode78
  # hmax  - limit the maximum stepsize to be less than or equal to hmax
  #
  # OUTPUT:
  # tout  - Returned integration time points (row-vector).
  # xout  - Returned solution, one solution column-vector per tout-value.
  #
  # The result can be displayed by: plot(tout, xout).
